mpcounts
========

Reconstruction of domain/gene counts using the maximum parsimony method: It requires that the tree exists as directory structure. The counts fo the leave nodes are expected to be in a file called mpcounts in the leave node's directories. First line is a header, first column contains the class name and the second column the counts of this class. So far, it reconstructs counts only for 10 clases (Wac,Wme,Wph,Wub,Rac,Rme,Rph,Eac,Eme,Eub). Any other class is ignored.
